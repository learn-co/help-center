# What is Teamviewer?

TeamViewer is a popular piece of software used for Internet-based remote access and support. You can think of it as google hangouts with extra functionality that's useful for Learn.

We use it to enable screensharing between you and the Learn team. Sometimes, text isn't the best way to handle a question or have a conversation. So we use TeamViewer as a way for you to share your screen with us and have a real-time conversation about what's happening in your code.

# How to Install TeamViewer

These instructions assume you're coming from "Ask a Question" on Learn after an Expert requested a screen share session with you. Please see the installation instructions for your operation system below. 

# Installing TeamViewer on Mac OS

1. If you're coming from an "Ask a Question" screenshare request modal, your download of Teamviewer should have already begun. If not, go to [Teamviewer Download Page](http://www.teamviewer.com/download/) and download it!
2. Once you download the .dmg, .exe, or .deb file, open it up and begin the installation.
3. Once you complete the installation, you may see another window pop-up like the one below. Click Continue and then skip through to the end. You do not need to setup Unattended Access. We won't be using it.
