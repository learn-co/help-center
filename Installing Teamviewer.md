# Steps to installing Teamviewer
 ([What is Teamviewer?](#see-below))

1. If you're coming from an "Ask a Question" screenshare request modal, your download of Teamviewer should have already begun. If not, go to [Teamviewer Download Page](http://www.teamviewer.com/download/) and download it!
2. Once you have downloaded the .dmg, .exe, or .deb file from Teamviewer, open it up and begin the installation.
3. Once you complete the installation, you will see another window pop-up like this:<img width="997" alt="screen shot 2016-06-29 at 2 49 43 pm" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1326555/16464635/186f682c-3e09-11e6-8419-58fefa96f2a1.png"> Click Continue and then skip the step to setup Unattended Access (we won't be using that) and then click Finish. Repeat, you shouldn't need to setup an account with Teamviewer to use it on Learn. It's FREE.
4. Once you've clicked Finish, go back to Learn and now you can launch into screenshares directly from Learn!
5. If you came from an "Ask a Question" screenshare request modal, you should now see a modal like this:<img width="278" alt="screen shot 2016-06-29 at 3 06 12 pm" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1326555/16465079/08559d7e-3e0b-11e6-92ae-f9531f59d210.png">
